# QR Code Generator - Customized QRCODE generated in an easy way.
This project demonstrates how to generate dynamic QR codes using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It offers a customizable and easy way to create QR codes that can change based on the content or parameters passed to the application. The project is designed to be fast, responsive, and scalable, offering a modern development environment with support for multiple languages.

## About
The QR Code Generator provides an intuitive interface to generate customized QR codes. With the integration of QRCode.react, you can create dynamic QR codes with various styles, sizes, and content directly from your web application. This project also supports multi-language functionality, allowing users to interact with the interface in their preferred language, thanks to the integration of i18next and react-i18next for internationalization.
